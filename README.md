# HOTEL-MANGEMENT-GUI-AND-NORMAL-PROGRAM-PYTHON-

I've created a hotel management system using Python 3, focusing on object-oriented programming concepts like classes and objects.

FOR THE GUI I HAVE USED TKINTER AND PAGE
THE NORMAL CODE IS NAMED AS MAIN.PY
TO RUN THE GUI JUST EXECUTE MAINLY.PY
